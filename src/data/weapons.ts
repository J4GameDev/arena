 * A weapon is an archetype, not a stat stick. Picking up a different weapon

 * TUNING: raw damage-per-second is roughly matched on purpose (greataxe 14.3,
 * daggers 12.0) so that the *empower cadence* is what separates them, not the
 * base numbers. If you widen that gap, one archetype simply wins.
